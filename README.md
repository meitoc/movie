Hi. This project is apart of my homework.
I use React.js for building front-end and PHP for back-end.
So sorry, i can't public the PHP code because of secure reasons.
In back-end, i create 2 flows for processing request.
- First is redirect to TheMovieBD by site secure API
- Second is account processing like login, logout, create account, change password, change user informations.
The important feature is the website being used same user database with others site.
A feature in back-end make the site more secure is a hardware OTP authentication. All request to create or change user secured data must be enter right OTP be send from my phone. This is automation feature.
